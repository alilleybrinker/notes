Author's note: the following is a reproduction of a thread I'd posted
on Twitter back in 2019. I am sharing it here because Twitter has
increasingly locked content behind a login prompt and I'd like to be able
to refer people to this material without them having to have a Twitter/X
account. The original thread can be found at [\[twitter\]][twitter].

So Steve Klabnik posted a really thoughtful piece on open source and free software
(read it if you haven't: [\[steve\]][steve]),
and the responses on places like Hacker News made an error that seems common in these
circles: believing working harder will solve a problem.

This comes up with people defending C, who argue "people should write better C." Of
course, this is nonsense. If a person can write better C consistently, we should
assume they will. If a person can, with extreme focus, write better C, that doesn't
mean they can sustain it.

It comes up with free software too. When someone points out the failures of the free
software movement, the response is "more people should believe in free software,
THEN we can deliver our goals." This is nonsense. You don't get more adherents by
demanding more adherents.

In both scenarios, people refuse to re-examine structures. It's not that C isn't
meeting our needs, it's that we're not good enough to meet them ourselves. It's not
that free software isn't achieving its goals, it's that not enough people believe in
it for it to succeed.

This is all tied to the underlying politics of the software developers, often
characterized as "technolibertarian," which believes strongly in the goodness of
technology, and the primacy of the individual in determining outcomes.

This ideology is diametrically opposed to the structuralist view the Steve appears to
be taking in his piece, or that tech critics are often taking in their critiques of
tech. It plays out in the thousand externalities of tech which go unaddressed.

What's frustrating about this ideology is it opposes resolution of structural problems,
against mounting evidence of their existence and the failure of existing solutions to
fix them. It also connects to a point about programming languages as political objects.

Steve's a leader in the Rust community, and that's no accident. Rust is a structural
response to C. Where a technolibertarian says "write better C," a Rustacean says
"write Rust, which changes the structure so it, and not you, carries the burden of
correctness."

This is not a small point. It's a microcosm of the fact that the technologies we build
are manifestations of our politics. It is not possible to keep politics out of tech,
because our politics shape how we approach problems, and what we build to fix them.

We have, as I see it, two competing cultures in tech. The dominant culture,
technolibertarianism, and the counter-culture, which I'll call technostructuralism.
These two cultures are often talking past each other, but they're building systems
that match their perspectives.

I know which side I prefer. Hopefully (maybe with a name, mine or someone else's)
the technostructuralists can come out of the closet and unify their technology with
their politics. At the very least, let's move the conversation.
